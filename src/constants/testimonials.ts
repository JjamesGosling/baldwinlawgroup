      "As a lawyer myself, I contacted two law firms regarding a real estate investment scam in which my elderly retired father invested. Each of those firms told me that my father had no case. I then contacted the investment fraud lawyers at Baldwin Mader Law Group. Baldwin Mader Law Group took my father’s case, promptly contacted the defendants, prepared a lawsuit, and within six weeks negotiated and finalized a settlement where all of my father's 'out of pocket' investment and almost all his legal fees were returned to him - without even filing the lawsuit. As a lawyer myself, I can attest that this was an extraordinary result. I highly recommend Baldwin Mader Law Group.",

    quote:
      "I contacted Chris and Pat on behalf of one of my clients. The client, and I, had a concern regarding a private debt investment she had held for many years prior to my association with her. She had been referred to several other attorneys who just did not 'get' what the issue was. I offered to do some interviewing for her. After a very pleasant call with Pat, I knew he 'got it' and then looped in my client to the conversation. Pat and Chris both worked the case with diligence and resolved it very successfully for the client. If you are looking for attorneys who will be forthright with you, to the point, and get the job done - these are your guys.",
