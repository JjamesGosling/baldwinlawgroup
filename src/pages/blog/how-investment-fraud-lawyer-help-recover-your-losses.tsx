          <p className="text-lg mb-2 mt-2">

          <ul className="text-lg mb-2 mt-2">
            <li>
              <b>Ponzi schemes:</b> These scams promise high returns with little
              risk, paying earlier investors with the capital of newer
              investors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pyramid schemes:</b> Similar to Ponzi schemes, these rely on
