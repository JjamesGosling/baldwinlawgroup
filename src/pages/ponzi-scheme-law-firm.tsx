             A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that lures investors with the promise of high returns, with the payouts to existing investors funded by money brought in from new investors. These schemes are inherently unsustainable, as eventually, the flow of new money dries up, and the scheme collapses, leaving investors with significant financial losses.

            <p className="mb-2"><strong>This is How Ponzi Schemes Work</strong></p>
            <p className="mb-2">
            Ponzi schemes typically follow this deceptive pattern:
            </p>
            <ul className="mb-2">
                <li><strong>Promise of High Returns</strong> – The perpetrator promises investors exceptionally high rates of return, often with little to no risk. This can be very enticing, especially compared to the lower returns offered by traditional investment options.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Payouts</strong> – Initial investors may receive payouts that appear legitimate, further fueling trust in the scheme. These payouts don’t actually come from any investment profits but rather from funds from new investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Perpetuating the Cycle</strong> – As the scheme progresses, the perpetrator needs a constant influx of new investors to maintain the illusion of profitability. They may resort to aggressive marketing tactics or pressure existing investors to reinvest their returns and recruit others.</li>
                <li><strong>The Inevitable Collapse</strong> – Eventually, the scheme reaches a tipping point where it can no longer attract enough new investors to keep up with the promised payouts. When this happens, the scheme crumbles and investors lose a significant portion, or even all, of their invested funds.</li>
